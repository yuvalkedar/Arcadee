Generally, the machine shoots basketballs and reloads them.

The user has two buttons in the app:
* First button is responsible for the aiming.
The user suppose to make a long press, which will make the launcher/canon sweep left and right repeatedly.
When the user releases the button, the canon stops in its current position.

* Then, the second button, which is responsible for the shooting strength, appears on the screen.
The user suppose to make a long press again in order to change the LED strength bar forth and back (there are 8 LEDs).
When the user releases the button, he determines the strength.

After releasing the second button, the magazine loads a ball to the canon.
The canon launches the ball. The machine then resets its position, the LED bar, etc. and reloads the ball to the magazine.

What is inside the loop?

The machine lets the user play only if there's a loaded ball ready for shooting, and finishes the game only when the ball is reloaded.
If the aiming button is pressed aiming_servo.Update() is called.
If the shooting button is pressed strength_timer starts, this timer is responsible for updating the strength.
The machine always checks for winning.

THE ISSUE: Once in a million games, the strength LED bar is stuck on the first LED. The machine's workflow routine isn't harmed; the user can keep playing -
when he will release the button what should happen will happen (the canon will shoot the ball, then the machine will reload the ball, and the game will over).
I use multiple timers, which I'm pretty sure are the reason for this issue.
I added FIXME where you should look at.
