"Gear Machine" is a progress arcade machine for Gigantic.
  
Arduino Uno communicates with RPi.
A hamer (instead of a claw) hits buttons.
There are two button types: Red and Blue.
Red btn = -1
Blue btn = +1

On the machine's background there is an LED matrix which shows the user's progress.
There are 4 levels (square frames) until one reaches the core and wins.

The trick? The floor, which includes the buttons, is spinning.
